=head1 NAME

Tickit::Widget::SparkLine - minimal graph implementation for L<Tickit>

=head1 VERSION

version 0.103

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $vbox = Tickit::Widget::VBox->new;
 my $widget = Tickit::Widget::SparkLine->new(
    data   => [ 0, 3, 2, 5, 1, 6, 0, 7 ]
 );
 $vbox->add($widget, expand => 1);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generates a mini ("sparkline") graph.

=begin HTML

=end HTML

=head1 STYLE

Set the base style background/foreground to determine the graph colours.
Note that reverse video and bold don't work very well on some terminals,
since the background+foreground colours won't match.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Instantiate the widget. Takes the following named parameters:

=over 4

=item * data - graph data

=back

=head2 data

Accessor for stored data.

With no parameters, returns the stored data as a list.

Pass either an array or an arrayref to set the data values and request display refresh.

=head2 data_chars

Returns the set of characters corresponding to the current data values. Each value
is assigned a single character, so the string length is equal to the number of data
items and represents the minimal string capable of representing all current data
items.

=head2 push

Helper method to add one or more items to the end of the list.

 $widget->push(3,4,2);

=head2 pop

Helper method to remove one item from the end of the list, returns the item.

 my $item = $widget->pop;

=head2 shift

Helper method to remove one item from the start of the list, returns the item.

 my $item = $widget->shift;

=head2 unshift

Helper method to add items to the start of the list. Takes a list.

 $widget->unshift(0, 1, 3);

=head2 splice

Equivalent to the standard Perl L<splice> function.

 # Insert 3,4,5 at position 2
 $widget->splice(2, 0, 3, 4, 5);

=head2 graph_steps

Returns an arrayref of characters in order of magnitude.

For example:

 [ ' ', qw(_ x X) ]

would yield a granularity of 4 steps.

Override this in subclasses to provide different visualisations - there's no limit to the number of
characters you provide in this arrayref.

=head2 resample

Given a width $w, resamples the data (remaining list of
parameters) to fit, using the current L</resample_method>.

Used internally.

=head2 render

Rendering implementation. Uses L</graph_steps> as the base character set.

=head2 char_for_value

Returns the character code corresponding to the given data value.

=head2 max_value

Returns the maximum value seen so far, used for autoscaling.

=head2 resample_mode

Change method for resampling when we have more data than will fit on the graph.

Current values include:

=over 4

=item * average - takes the average of combined values for this bucket

=item * min - lowest value for this bucket

=item * median - highest value for this bucket

=item * max - largest value for this bucket

=item * peak - alias for 'max'

=back

The default is 'average'.

Returns $self if setting a value, or the current value.
